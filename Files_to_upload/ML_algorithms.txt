Machine Learning Algorithms:
1. Linear Regression: Predicts a continuous target variable based on input features.
2. Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification tasks.
3. Decision Trees: Tree-based model for classification and regression.
4. Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy.
5. Support Vector Machine (SVM): Classifies data by finding the optimal hyperplane.
6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies based on the majority label of nearest neighbors.
7. Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes theorem.
8. K-Means: Clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning.
9. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Dimensionality reduction technique.
10. Neural Networks: Models inspired by human brain structure for complex tasks.
